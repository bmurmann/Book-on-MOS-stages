Analog integrated circuit (IC) design is often viewed as a “black art,” accessible only to those with special talent or years of experience. As an attempt to disprove
this stereotype, this book was written to provide a customized introduction for the beginner with a minimum amount of prerequisite knowledge. Specifically, the material is positioned to fill the gap between general introductions on analog circuits, which are usually centered on discrete (printed circuit board) components, and advanced graduate books on integrated circuits. The need for filling the gap between these two types of texts has become stronger over the past decades for several reasons. The first is that advanced material has become less accessible for the inexperienced learner due to the growing complexity associated with the state of the art. A second reason is that today’s typical intro course sequence has been expanded to include embedded system design; this leaves very little time to cover analog circuit principles at a level that is required for advanced study.
