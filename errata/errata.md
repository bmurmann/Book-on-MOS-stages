|p. 17, P1.5   |    |    |The problem is unneccesarily complex with $r_i$, $r_o$, $r_1$ and $r_2$ included. The problem should be worked with $r_i$, $r_o$ removed and $r_1=r_2=0$. Also, the following note should be added to part (a): Note that since this circuit is bilateral, $R_S$ must be considered when computing $R_{out}$, and $R_L$ must be considered when computing $R_{in}$. |
|p. 17, P1.8  |    |     |The problem statement is missing values for $R_S$ and $R_L$. Use $R_S=R_L=10~k\Omega$. Also, $A_{if}$ and $A_{ir}$ are equal, so the conclusion must be drawn bassed on $R_{in}$ and $R_{out}$. |
|p. 20, second column, Eq. 2.1 |$I_D(y) = W \cdot Q_n(y) \cdot v(y)$  |$I_D = -W \cdot Q_n(y) \cdot v(y)$ |$I_D$ is constant throughout the channel (no dependence on $y$). Since $I_D$ is defined as flowing into the drain, its mathematical definition in Eq. 2.1 requires a negative sign. The original right side of Eq. 2.1 shows the current flowing in the positive y direction, which is opposite the direction of $I_D$. |
|p. 20, second column, last paragraph |$E(y) = dV(y)/dy$  |$E(y) = -dV(y)/dy$  |  |
