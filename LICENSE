LTspiceÂ® is a high performance SPICE simulation software, schematic capture
and waveform viewer with enhancements and models for easing the simulation
of analog circuits. Included in the download of LTspice are macromodels for
a majority of Analog Devices switching regulators, amplifiers, as well as a
library of devices for general circuit simulation.
